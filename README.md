# Rescue.ai

Rescue.ai is an advanced AI-driven emergency response platform designed to assist users in critical situations by providing immediate support when traditional services like 911 are overwhelmed. The platform leverages state-of-the-art technology to handle emergency calls, analyze voice data, and dispatch appropriate teams to the scene, ensuring quick and effective responses.

## Features

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Secure authentication using Phone, Password, Driver's License, Face Capture, and Full Address.
- [ ] **Blockchain Verification**: Ensures the integrity and security of user identity data through blockchain technology.
- [ ] **Geofencing**: Verifies the userâ€™s location to authenticate emergency requests within the service area.

### 2. Handling Multiple Call Requests
- [ ] **Apache Kafka Integration**: Efficiently handles multiple incoming emergency calls using Apache Kafka for high-throughput messaging.
- [ ] **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Distributes requests evenly across Kafka brokers for fault tolerance and high availability.
- [ ] **Prioritization Queue**: Ensures critical calls are prioritized and processed first using a smart prioritization algorithm.
- [ ] **Event-Driven Architecture**: Employs an event-driven microservices architecture for scalable and responsive operations.

### 3. Voice-to-Text Generator
- [ ] **Real-Time Processing**: Converts voice to text in real-time and processes it through a custom Transformer Model to generate structured responses.
- [ ] **Contextual Awareness**: Adapts responses based on the context of the emergency, improving communication accuracy.
- [ ] **Emotion Detection**: Analyzes the caller's tone and speech patterns to detect emotions and categorize the level of urgency.
- [ ] **Multi-Language Support**: Supports multiple languages and dialects to ensure accessibility for a diverse user base.

### 4. Human-Like AI Interaction

- [ ] **Adaptive Interaction**: Modifies communication style based on the detected emotional state of the user.
- [ ] **Empathy Simulation**: Trains the AI to exhibit empathy, improving user experience during high-stress situations.

### 5. Load Handler
- [ ] **911 Integration**: Activates only when traditional 911 services are busy, serving as a backup emergency response system.
- [ ] **Bot Cloning**: Instantly clones Rescue Bots when one is busy to handle additional users, ensuring no call goes unanswered.
- [ ] **Intelligent Load Prediction**: Predicts peak times and preemptively allocates resources to handle increased demand.
- [ ] **Seamless Handoff**: Transfers sessions between bots without disrupting user interaction.

### 6. Ticket Dispatch System
- [ ] **Automated Routing**: Automatically routes tickets to the appropriate team (Police, Fire Department, Ambulance) based on urgency and resource availability.
- [ ] **Cross-Agency Collaboration**: Enables real-time communication and updates between emergency response teams for coordinated efforts.
- [ ] **Incident Management Dashboard**: Centralizes ticket information, status updates, and resource allocation for a comprehensive view of ongoing emergencies.
